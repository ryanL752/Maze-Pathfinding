AI Maze Pathfinding Project

Overview
This project implements pathfinding algorithms in a procedurally generated maze environment using Unity 2022.3.53f1. 

The goal is to compare the performance and behavior of two widely-used algorithms: 
  Dijkstra's Algorithm
  A-Star Algorithm

Instructions:
   1) Ensure Unity 2022.3.53f1 is installed on your system.
   2) Open the project in Unity Hub.
   3) Navigate to the Scenes folder in the Unity Editor.
   4) Open the Maze scene to start the demonstration.
   5) Press the Play button in the Unity Editor to begin.
